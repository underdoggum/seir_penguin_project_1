# Project 1 Documentation
## by Nathan Noack


## Introduction
Welcome to my first full-fledged web development project!  
This is the first project administered in General Assembly's Software Engineering Immersive bootcamp, which uses the Front-End web development technologies listed below.

(Explain what is your project here, what does it do, etc.)
(Update this documentation as you do your project)


## Technologies Used
#### Basic
 - HTML5
 - CSS3
 - JavaScript ES6
 - jQuery

 #### Libraries / Techniques
 - Mobile-first
 - AMP
 - CSS Animations
 - Figma (wireframing)
 - Deployed with Vercel
 - Using Contentful as the headless CMS for the backend


## General Plan of Action
1. Get data about Trivia questions and answers and read Contentful API docs to gain access
2. Set up a mock wireframe for the barebones skeleton look of the web page
3. Implement functionality
4. Add styling
5. Clean up code
6. Add extra features


## Timeline
#### Day 0:
 - Create boilerplate code for index.html, styles.css, app.js locally using VSCode
 - Sign up for Vercel and host relevant GitHub repo linked to local git repo
 - Sign up for Contentful to host headless CMS for backend data-fetching
 - Creating Trivia questions/answers and loading them into Contentful database
 - Testing connection


## Challenges
(put bug-shooting, any other troubles encountered here)

#### I had trouble with...

(ex.)
 ```js
 console.log('hello world")   // need to match quotes
 ```

 It was giving me a problem blah blah blah... when it was fixed, it looked like this:

 ```js
 console.log("goodbye world");
 ```

#### Example Table
| Column1 | Column 2 |
| ------- | -------- |
| yadda1  | yadda2   |
